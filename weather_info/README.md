# Weather App

Welcome to my Weather App! üå§Ô∏èüåßÔ∏è

This is a simple desktop weather application that allows you to check the current weather for any city. It's built using Python and the Tkinter library for the graphical user interface (GUI), and it fetches weather data using the OpenWeatherMap API.

## Getting Started

These instructions will help you get the project up and running on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

1. **Python**: Ensure you have Python installed. If not, you can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

2. **Git**: You'll need Git to clone the repository. Download it from [git-scm.com](https://git-scm.com/).

### Setting Up

1. **Clone the Repository**:

   Open your terminal or command prompt and run:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/krixx646/weather.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the Project Directory**:

   ```bash
   cd weather
   ```

3. **Set Up a Virtual Environment**:

   Create a virtual environment to manage dependencies:

   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   ```

   Activate the virtual environment:

   - On Windows:

     ```bash
     venv\Scripts\activate
     ```

   - On macOS/Linux:

     ```bash
     source venv/bin/activate
     ```

4. **Install Dependencies**:

   Install the required Python packages:

   ```bash
   pip install requests
   ```

   Tkinter should be included with Python, but if you encounter issues, you might need to install it separately based on your operating system.

5. **Obtain an API Key**:

   - Sign up for a free API key from [OpenWeatherMap](https://home.openweathermap.org/users/sign_up).
   - Replace `"your_api_key"` in `logic.py` with your actual API key.

6. **Run the Application**:

   To start the application, use:

   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

   A window will pop up where you can enter a city name and check the weather!

## Project Structure

Here's a brief overview of the project files:

- `main.py`: The entry point of the application.
- `gui.py`: Contains the code for the GUI using Tkinter.
- `logic.py`: Handles fetching weather data from the OpenWeatherMap API.
- `utils.py`: Manages file operations for saving and loading user preferences.
- `data/`: Directory for storing user preferences.

## Features

- **Fetch Weather Data**: Get current weather information for any city.
- **Display Weather**: Shows temperature and weather description.
- **User Input**: Enter and search for weather by city name.
- **Error Handling**: Handles errors like invalid city names or network issues.
- **Save Preferences**: Saves the last searched city to a file.

## Troubleshooting

If you run into any issues:

- Make sure you have the correct API key and it‚Äôs placed in `logic.py`.
- Ensure all dependencies are installed.
- Verify you are running the script from within the virtual environment.
